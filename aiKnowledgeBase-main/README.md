# AI History/Definition Knowledge Based System

This Python program is an interactive knowledge-based system that provides information about the history and definition of Artificial Intelligence (AI).

## How it works

The program uses a dictionary to store facts about AI. The user can ask questions and the program will respond with relevant information from the dictionary.

The program can answer questions about:

- The history of AI
- The types of AI (weak/narrow AI and strong AI)
- The importance of AI
- The definition of AI
- The Turing Test

The program continues to prompt the user for questions until the user decides to exit by typing 'end', 'exit', 'quit', 'q', or simply pressing enter without typing anything.

## How to run the program

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Clone this repository or download the `aiHistory.py` file.
3. Open a terminal/command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the `aiHistory.py` file.
4. Run the command `python aiHistory.py`.
5. The program will start and you can begin asking questions.

## Note

This is a simple program and does not understand complex queries. It matches keywords in the user's input to determine the appropriate response. If it does not understand the question, it will respond with "I have no knowledge or I'm not sure what you mean?"
